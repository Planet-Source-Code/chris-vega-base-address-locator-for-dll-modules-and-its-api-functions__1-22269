### Description

Dynamic Link Library are located on certain space within your windows system; locating where they are always included on advanced programmers tasklist; This includes the Virtual Space of every exported API-Functions. Now, you might ask me whats the use of it, well in C++ and Win32 Assembly, we are able to call the API-Functions directly without *Importing* it to the Executable, making our code Smaller and Faster (Direct Calling) In which I am trying to achieve here using Visual Basic; If somehow you know how to directly Call/Access API-Functions using Memory Address, please drop me an email; thanks.
